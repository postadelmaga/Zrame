//! # zrame.chrome — the backend-agnostic frame composition
//!
//! Everything a window backend does that is *not* talking to the OS: the cross-thread
//! frame mailbox (`Staged` + `SpinLock`, staged under `presentRgba`, swapped on the window
//! thread) and the composition itself (`composeContent`: the app `on_draw` overlay, the
//! newest staged content frame blitted into the content rect, then the panel stack on
//! top). Both `window_wayland.zig` and `window_win32.zig` share this, so the one thing most
//! likely to drift between platforms — *how a frame is composited* — lives in one place.
//!
//! Backends keep only the transport: acquiring a writable pixel buffer, filling its
//! background (glass chrome on Wayland, an opaque fill on Win32), calling `composeContent`,
//! and presenting the result however the OS allows.
