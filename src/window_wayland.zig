//! One Wayland toplevel, no server decorations: the chrome (rounded glass panel, drop
//! shadow) is painted client-side by [`paint`], the frosted look comes from the
//! compositor via `ext-background-effect-v1` (real background blur, KWin 6.4+), and the
//! shadow gutter is punched out of the input region so clicks fall through it.
//!
//! Threading contract: everything Wayland happens on the thread that calls [`run`].
//! [`presentRgba`] is the one cross-thread door — it stages pixels under a mutex and
//! pokes an eventfd, and the run loop picks them up. That is exactly the shape zicro's
//! `video.FrameSink` needs (see `sink.zig`).
